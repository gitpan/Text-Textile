Text::Textile

Some brief notes.

Text::Textile implements the Textile formatting language as outlined at
http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/. The actual code was written by Brad
Choate (http://www.bradchoate.com/) for his Movable Type plugin
(http://www.bradchoate.com/past/mttextile.php). I've stolen the code, thrown
away most of the wrapper, and added an exportable function. Not complex
stuff.
