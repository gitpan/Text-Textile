For the original readme file that came with the MT-Textile plugin, see
README.textile in the root of this distribution.

I claim no credit for either coming up with the Textile formatting language, or
for this perl implementation of it (although I have made some small perl cleanups that I felt helped the code), I've only packaged it. All credit for Textile should go to Dean Allen and/or Brad Choate, and all blame for problems to myself.

Thanks for the liberal license, guys, so I could release this code.
